Purpose: To order the z atom postions from a POSCAR or VASP file from lowest to greatest.----------- For Selective Dynamics----------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE: Run the code, and two inputs will be asked to the user. 1: THE name of the atom, Ex. Pt, Ru, Au, ......| 2. The name of the input file. ######NOTE###### Make sure the file is in the same dir as the list_order.py file

OUTCOME: The code will give a file as inputfil.F, which will have the same format as VASP or POSCAR format, with z postions order from lowest to greatest. 

Example: POSCAR_EX is a POSCAR file that should be used. RUN list_list.py with POSCAR_EX to make sure everything is running well.
